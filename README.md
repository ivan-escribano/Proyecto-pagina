# Personal Website

üíñThis was my first project back then when I started learning to program, and I have so much appreciation, it's not made with any framework it's just 100% JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5 made by me. Maybe it's not the most common way but it reminds me of where i come from and where I am today.
